## Project Data Analysis

**List the data that you expect to use, collect or create in your
project. Identify if you are generating or collecting the data and if
you are using existing datasets?**

Data that I expect to collect:

- Chromatograms

Data that I expect to create:

- Pre-processed data
- Statistical test analyses

**Are there legal or ethical restrictions that you will need to
address?**

Since my project uses samples from patients, the personal information
from patients are a potential ethical restriction. To mitigate this, the
data will be deidentified prior to analyzing the data.

**Go through the Quick Hits for Data Management and identify possible
strategies to build and protect the value of your data.**

**Where will you keep raw data and how will you back it up?**

I will keep raw data on my work computer, in the cloud, and on an
external hard drive. I plan to backup my data every month on the first
day of the month. For each backup, I will make a new folder with the
date for the backup. If there are any folders in my backup files that
are 1 year or older, I will delete those folders.

**What file formats do you anticipate your data will be in? Are the
formats open or can they be converted to open formats?**

I anticipate my file formats will be in a .d file format. This file
format can only be read by a software that is paid for. However, there
are ways to convert the file to a different format that can be read by
other software.

**Create a File naming convention for your project data.**

Project_Name-Range_of_Samples-Method_of_Analysis-Initials-Date(YYYYMMDD)

**What standards are relevant to your project? List any existing
standards or best practices in use in your field or in your lab? This
could include instrument procedures or file management standards. What
standards might you want to create to help you manage your data?**

Currently, these are some standards/best practices that are used in our
lab:

- “Logs” document which documents everything that the machines (e.g.,
  mass spectrometery) do during an experiment
- Lab notebooks with detailed notes to keep track of experiments
- Consistent file naming and folder organization for data files produced
  from the machines

I would want to create the following standards:

- Scanning my lab notebook to ensure I have a digital copy of my lab
  notebook in case something happens to the physical version
- Backing up the scans in another location

**List possible strategies you might use to document your data
throughout your project.**

I will document my data throughout my project using the following
strategies:

- Using a lab notebook to keep track of what took place during
  experiments
- Ensure the names of my files are consistent and contain all the
  information needed, and document these names in my lab notebook
- Keeping track of the different versions of my files using Dropbox,
  which maintains an edit history of files
